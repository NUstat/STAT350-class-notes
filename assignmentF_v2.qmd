## Instructions {-}

1. You may talk to a friend, discuss the questions and potential directions for solving them. However, you need to write your own solutions and code separately, and not as a group activity. 

2. Do not write your name on the assignment.

3. Make R code chunks to insert code and type your answer outside the code chunks. Ensure that the solution is written neatly enough to understand and grade.

4. Render the file as HTML to submit.

5. There are 5 points for clealiness and organization. The code should be commented and clearly written with intuitive variable names. For example, use variable names such as number_input, factor, hours, instead of a,b,xyz, etc.

6. The assignment is worth 100 points, and is due on **30th May 2023 at 11:59 pm**. 

7. You are **not allowed to use a `for` loop** in this assignment, except in the last question on Sudoku.
