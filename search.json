If you have an earlier version of R already installed, you may continue to use it, or you can uninstall it and then install the most recent version, which is R 4.3.1."

Such a file will usually end with the extensions *.txt or *.dat. The data files for this course will always be available on the CD that comes with the text and/or on the course web page. A data file will consist of columns of numbers, with nothing separating the columns but “white space.” If each column has a title on top describing what the data in the column represents (e.g., age, weight, income, etc.), we will say that the file has a header."

For example mine is C:\\stat350.\nTo set up the working directory, select the project option by choosing File menu, then New Project, and then Create Project from Existing Directory.\nTo start writing a new R script, navigate to the New File option in the File menu, and select Quarto Document. This will create a *.qmd file. You can write both code and formatted-text in this document. When working on assignment / exam problems, you will work on the *.qmd file, render it as HTML and then submit. You can view some examples on how to write R code and text in a *.qmd file and render it as HTML here.\nFor rough work, i.e., work that won’t be graded, you may use the R script option to write code."

Assume the file has no header. You will want to create a Table object in R containing this data. First choose an appropriate name for the table. Assume you choose to name it Data. Then, you can execute the following code :\n\nData &lt;- read.table(\"./Datasets/CH01PR19.txt\")\n\nThen there will be a Table object in R named Data containing the data in rows and columns. To view it, you would type\n\nData\n\nHowever, if it is a large file, you might not be able to view the whole table at once. In that case, you may use the head() function, which will display only the first 6 rows of Data:\n\nhead(Data)\n\n     V1 V2\n1 3.897 21\n2 3.885 14\n3 3.778 28\n4 2.540 22\n5 3.028 21\n6 3.865 31"
