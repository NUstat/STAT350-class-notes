You may talk to a friend, discuss the questions and potential directions for solving them. However, you need to write your own solutions and code separately, and not as a group activity. \n\n2. Do not write your name on the assignment.\n\n3. Write your code in the *Code* cells of the Jupyter notebook. Ensure that the solution is written neatly enough to understand and grade.\n\n4. Use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html) to print the *.ipynb* file as HTML. You will need to open the command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the file, and use the command: `quarto render filename.ipynb --to html`. Submit the HTML file.\n\n5. There are 5 points for clealiness and organization. The breakdow is as follows:\n\n- Must be an HTML file rendered using Quarto (1.5 pts). \n\n- There aren’t excessively long outputs of extraneous information (e.g. no printouts of unnecessary results without good reason, there aren’t long printouts of which iteration a loop is on, there aren’t long sections of commented-out code, etc.) (1 pt)\n\n- There is no piece of unnecessary / redundant code, and no unnecessary / redundant text (1 pt)\n\n- The code should be commented and clearly written with intuitive variable names. For example, use variable names such as number_input, factor, hours, instead of a,b,xyz, etc. (1.5 pts)\n\n6. The assignment is worth 100 points, and is due on **Friday, 21st April 2023 at 11:59 pm**. \n\n## Sentence analysis\n### Word count\nWrite a function that accepts a word, and a sentence as arguments, and returns the number of times the word occurs in the sentence. \n\nCall the function, and print the returned value if the word is \"*sea*\", and the sentence is \"*She sells sea shells on the sea shore when the sea is calm.*\" Note that this is just an example to check your function. Your function should work for any word and sentence.\n\n*(10 points)*\n\n### Max word count\nAsk the user to input a sentence. Use the function in B.1.1 to find the word that occurs the maximum number of times in the sentence. Print the word and its number of occurences. If multiple words occur the maximum number of times, then you can print any one of them.\n\nCheck your program when the user inputs the sentence, \"*She sells sea shells on the sea shore when the sea is calm.*\". Your program must print, \"*The word with the maximum number of occurences is 'sea' and it occurs 3 times.\"* Note that this is just an example to check your program. Your program must work for any sentence. \n\n*(20 points)*\n\n## Prime factors\n### Prime \nWrite a function that checks if an integer is prime. The function must accept the integer as an argument, and return `True` if the integer is prime, otherwise it must return `False`.\n\nCall your function with the argument as `197`.\n\n*(4 points)*\n\n### Factor\nWrite a function that checks if an integer is a factor of another integer. The function must accept both the integers as arguments, and return `True` if the integer is a factor, otherwise it must return `False`.\n\nCall your function with the arguments as `(19,85)`.\n\n*(3 points)*\n\n### Prime Factors\nPrompt the user to input a positive integer. Use the functions in B.2.1 and B.2.2 to print the prime factors of the integer. Your program should be no more than 4 lines (excluding the comments)\n\nCheck your program is the user inputs 190\n\n*(8 points)*\n\n## Binary search\n### Word search\n\nThe tuple below named as `tuple_of_words` consists of words. Write a function that accepts a word, say `word_to_search` and the `tuple_of_words` as arguments, and finds if the `word_to_search` occurs in the `tuple_of_words` or not. This is very simple to do with the code `word_to_search in tuple_of_words`. However, this code is unfortunately very slow.\n\nAs the words in the `tuple_of_words` are already sorted in alphabetical order, we can search using a faster way, called binary search. To implement binary search in a function, start by comparing `word_to_search` with the middle entry in the `tuple_of_words`. If they are equal, then you are done and the function should return `True`. On the other hand, if the `word_to_search` comes before the middle entry, then search the first half of `tuple_of_words`. If it comes after the middle entry, then search the second half of `tuple_of_words`. Then repeat the process on the appropriate half of the `tuple_of_words` and continue until the word is found or there is nothing left to search, in which case the function short return `False`. The `<` and `>` operators can be used to alphabetically compare two strings.\n\nYou may write just one function or multiple functions to solve this problem.\n\nCheck your function if the `word_to_search` is:\n\n1. `'rocket'`\n\n2. `'rest'`\n\n3. `'ambush'`\n\n\n*(25 points)*\n\n### Iterations to find the word \nUpdate the function in B.3.1 to also print the number of iterations it took to find the `word_to_search` or fail in finding the `word_to_search`.\n\nCheck your function if the `word_to_search` is:\n\n1. `'rocket'`\n\n2. `'rest'`\n\n3. `'amendable'`\n\n*(10 points)*\n\n### Index of word\nUpdate the function in B.3.2 to also print the index of `word_to_search` in `tuple_of_words` if the word is found in the tuple. For example, the index of 'abacus' is 0, the index of 'abdomen' is 1, and so on.\n\nCheck your function if the `'word_to_search'` is:\n\n1. `'rocket'`\n\n2. `'rest'`\n\n3. `'ambush'`\n\n*(10 points)*\n\n### Maximum iterations\nWhat is the maximum number of iterations it may take for your function to search or fail in searching the `word_to_search`. You may either write a program to answer this question, or answer it analytically.\n\n*(5 points)*\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"show","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"self-contained":true,"output-file":"Assignment 2 (control flow).html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.37","bibliography":["references.bib"],"theme":"cosmo","title":"Assignment B","jupyter":"python3","toc-title":"Contents"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"Assignment 2 (control flow).pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"documentclass":"scrreprt","title":"Assignment B","jupyter":"python3"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
