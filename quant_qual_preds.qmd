#Quantitative & Qualitative predictors

In this chapter, we'll introduce interactions, and then develop and interpret models with interactions among quantitative predictors, and interactions between quantitative and qualitative predictors.

## Variable interactions

Let us consider the file *car_data.csv*. 

```{r}
# Reading data
car_data <- read.csv('./Datasets/car_data.csv')
head(car_data)
```

In an additive model, we assume that the association between a predictor $X_j$ and response $Y$ does not depend on the value of other predictors. For example, consider the multiple linear regression model below.

```{r}
# Additive model
additive_model <- lm(price~year+engineSize+mileage+mpg, data = car_data)
summary(additive_model)
```

The above model assumes that the average increase in price associated with a unit increase in `engineSize` is always $12,180, regardless of the value of other predictors. However, this assumption may be incorrect.
